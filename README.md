# The Thrush Compiler 

The compiler is responsible for translating each code effectively into LLVM intermediate code so that LLVM effectively compiles each scenario to the indicated architecture. LLVM is the main code generator for thrushc; it is speculated that in the future, GCC will be used.

# Â¿How it works?

Currently, the only backend available for the thrush compiler to compile is the current LLVM, using the LLVM-C API. The process consists of three parts:

1. Compilation by thrushc to LLVM bitcode (*.bc).
2. Optimization by the LLVM optimization tool (opt & llvm-lto).
3. Final compilation by clang to the target.

In summary:

## Build dependencies

**Important Rust crates:**

- **llvm-sys** (v170)
- **inkwell** (v0.50)
  
## Requirements for create executables with the compiler

### Linux Toolchain

- [LLVM & Clang Toolchain (x64)](https://github.com/thrushlang/toolchains/releases/download/Toolchains/thrushlang-toolchain-linux-x64-v1.0.1.tar.gz)

> [!NOTE]  
> The language will contain a **pre-optimized** toolchain repository for each operating system. This process automates the installation of the language and its entire ecosystem through the **Thorium** package manager.
